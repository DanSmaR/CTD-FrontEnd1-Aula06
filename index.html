    <p>Quincy Larson was a school director for six years before he started to learn to code so that he could create tools for making schools more efficient. His own journey into learning to code was long and winding and he recognized the need for a single-track
        curriculum for newbie developers. Upon analyzing data on coding boot camps in the US and realizing how inaccessible coding education was to the masses, he set out to create a fully-online inclusive free platform for peer-driven learning of coding
        - the result of which is <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong></strong>. He lives in Texas with his family and spends his time working on freeCodeCamp, writing and interviewing authors for the freeCodeCamp publication, co-ordinating open source projects
        such as Chapter (a free MeetUp alternative), advocating for a free and open internet and playing with his two young kids.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><span>2014:</span> freeCodeCamp was launched in October 2014 and incorporated as Free Code Camp, Inc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span>2015:</span> In a 2015 podcast interview, he summarized his motivation for creating freeCodeCamp as follows:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/10/28/free-code-camp-with-quincy-larson/">"freeCodeCamp is my effort to correct the extremely inefficient and circuitous way I learned to code. I'm committing my career and the rest of my life towards making this process as efficient and painless as possible. [...] All those things
                that made learning to code a nightmare to me are things that we are trying to fix with freeCodeCamp."</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><span>2016:</span> The curriculum was updated in January 2016 to rely less on outside material, remove the unconventional section names, and switch focus from AngularJS to React.js as the front-end library of choice. There were a number of
                additions to the coursework, including D3.js and Sass, which brought the total time estimate to 2,080 hours and two more certificates, data visualization, and back-end.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <p>freeCodeCamp's platform is used by about 350,000 unique visitors per month with students from over 160 countries. FreeCodeCamp has international, community-run groups where students can interact in person. Some groups have been featured in local news,
        citing freeCodeCamp as an introduction to programming in order to fill the estimated vacancy in programming-related jobs in the next decade.</p>
